## IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE (integrated development environment) for Java development. It has many features that make it a great choice for Java development. However, it is also a very large development environment and can be overwhelming at first. For this class, we are not requiring *which* IDE you use, but we do require that you use an IDE that supports Java development. 

To install IntelliJ IDEA, while there is a community edition which is fine, you can also install the "Ultimate" edition using your student email  to setup a free license. To earn a free license go to [JetBrains Student License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) and follow the instructions. Make sure to use your student email.

You can then download the ultimate edition from [JetBrains Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), and register it with your student account. 

It is also a popular choice to use [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/) to manage your IDEs. If you use the toolbox, it is better to install the ultimate edition from the toolbox, as then it will be managed by the toolbox. 


### Plugins
Here are some plugins for IntelliJ IDEA if you are using it for Java development:

* [IntelliJ Mermaid Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20146-mermaid)
* [Markdown Plugin IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7793-markdown) 

To find where to install plugins in IntelliJ IDEA, go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins` and search for the plugin you want to install. 

## Visual Studio Code (VS code)

VS Code is another popular choice for Java development. It is a lightweight IDE that is easy to use and has many features that make it a great choice for Java development. Where IntelliJ IDEA focuses on a contained environment, VS Code focuses on module extensions for everything it does. As such, you will find there are more extensions. Due to this module based design along with it being completely free, VS Code has gained in popularity over the years. 

Different professors lean towards different IDEs, Dr. Lionelle leans towards VS Code for his own work, but does not require you to use it. Even the TAs will use different IDEs. The choice is yours. 


### Extensions
